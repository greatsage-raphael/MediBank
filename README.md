## How it works
It enables a user  to easily save their medical records to a Decentralized Web Node and easily share them to any medical provider safely and privately. This action requires both the user and medical provider to have DID's to enable secure communication between the parties. The DID also acts as a key that enables the user to create, read and delete records added to the DWN
